# Change Log

## v3.0.0

v3.0.0 adds support for CollectionSpace 7.0.

### Breaking Changes

- The record editor form for material records now uses the `featuredCollectionGroupList/featuredCollectionGroup` repeating group, added in CollectionSpace 7.0. To use this version of the material record with an older CollectionSpace server, this field group should be hidden; otherwise, any values entered will not be saved.

## v2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

Version 2.0.0 requires cspace-ui version 4.
